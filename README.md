This repository contains a prototype R package for generating projects prioritizations. The lessons we learned while working on this package enabled us to create the [_oppr R_ package](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr)---a fully fledged R package for developing project prioritizations using a range of objectives and constraints---so please check out the [_oppr R_ package](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr) for developing prioritizations.
